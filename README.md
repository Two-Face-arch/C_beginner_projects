# C_beginner_projects
Just some beginner projects that I want to make to get a hang of the language. After that I am planning to engage in some complex ones
# Code execution 
Most of my code will be using some some specific linux libraries ( I use arch btw) , so it would be better if you would just check the code and modify it after copying ,if you are on a mac or windows.
After the that just compile and run the executable.
# License
I know licensing such simple and obvious projects is stupid but nonetheless I belive in the principles of FOSS so I have licensed it under- GPL-3.0
